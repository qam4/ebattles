## Rankings ##
There are 2 types of ranking calculation available to event admins:
  * _Classic_:
    * Players are ranked based on their score in the first stats category, if 2 players are tied, they are ranked based on the second stats category, and so on.
  * _Combined Stats_:
    * the rating calculation is based on each players score in a set of ranking categories.
    * Each category is assigned a max value which is attributed to the player who scores best in that category.

    * Overall score is the sum of the categories scores.
